                <p>
                    Welcome to Meows & Brews, a cat café experience designed to bring comfort, caffeine, and cuddles together. These Terms and Conditions govern your access to and use of our café, services, website, and facilities. By entering our premises or using our online platforms, you agree to comply with the following terms. Please read them carefully to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all guests—feline and human alike.
                </p>
                
                <h3>1. GENERAL OVERVIEW</h3>
                <p>
                    Meows & Brews is a physical café space offering specialty drinks, snacks, and time with our resident cats. We also provide services through our website, such as online reservations, event bookings, and general inquiries. These Terms and Conditions apply to all patrons who visit the café or use our online platforms.
                </p>
                
                <h3>2. GUEST CONDUCT AND CAFE RULES</h3>
                <p>
                    Guests must interact with our cats gently and respectfully. Picking up, chasing, or disturbing the cats—especially when they are resting—is not allowed. Please maintain a calm tone and avoid loud noises or sudden movements that could distress the animals. Flash photography, feeding the cats, or bringing outside pets is prohibited.<br>
                    Children under the age of 12 must be closely supervised by a responsible adult at all times. We reserve the right to ask guests to leave the premises for disruptive or inappropriate behavior.
                </p>
                
                <h3>3. HEALTH, SAFETY, AND LIABILITY</h3>
                <p>
                    All interactions with our cats are at the guest's own risk. While our cats are friendly and well-socialized, they are still animals with instincts, and occasional scratches or allergic reactions may occur. Meows & Brews is not liable for injuries or medical conditions resulting from cat interactions or consumption of food and beverages on the premises.<br>
                    Please inform our staff of any food allergies before placing your order. We strive to provide allergen information, but cross-contamination is possible.
